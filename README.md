# Evalet-mobile-app
This app was for my Final B.S project.
Worked as part of a 2-person team developing an application which integrates React-Native with Google Maps API and Firebase DB in helping valet parking employees in urban areas park and retrieve cars in an efficient and accurate manner.
The PDF file attached explains everything and contains screenshots of the mobile application.
